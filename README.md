The major setback is that it is a CLI based app

A hospital Management System which has features like
admits a new patient and asks about most of their details, i have done some error handling anol here. assigns a MRN & room no and saves it to a file
discharges patients,
checks up on patient details,
handles the medical equipment,
handles the blood supply,
info on docs & nurses, & appoints or fires them
books an appointment or cancel them

    And I've made getting the MRN number only once and never again, u just have to remember it
